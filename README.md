This is my portfolio site designed to showcase various things I've written and to flex my website building skills. The goal is to make this visually interesting while containing some clever dynamic items.

Planned: 
1. Pixelated terminal Instagram feed
2. Zalgo color fader
3. employee database grep script
4. ... ?!?!
5. ?!!?!?!?!? :(
